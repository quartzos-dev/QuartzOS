# QuartzOS Fair Use Policy

Version: 1.0
Effective date: February 24, 2026

## 1. Purpose
This policy defines acceptable operational use of QuartzOS and related services.

## 2. Acceptable use
- Legitimate personal, educational, development, or approved commercial use.
- Security testing only when explicitly authorized.
- Reasonable system and network activity consistent with your license tier.

## 3. Prohibited use
- Malware distribution, botnet activity, credential theft, or abuse.
- Denial-of-service or traffic flooding.
- License fraud, key sharing, or verification bypass attempts.
- Unauthorized probing of protected verification endpoints.
- Any use violating applicable law.

## 4. Resource fairness
Users must avoid behavior that causes unreasonable degradation of shared environments, including:
- sustained abusive CPU/memory/network use,
- high-volume unsolicited scanning,
- repeated automated failed activation attempts.

## 5. Security compliance
You must not disable, tamper with, or circumvent:
- integrity checks,
- license checks,
- fail-safes,
- or kernel security enforcement.

## 6. Enforcement
QuartzOS Dev may:
- throttle or block actions,
- revoke licenses,
- enforce lock mode,
- suspend or terminate use,
if fair use rules are violated.

## 7. Appeals
If you believe enforcement was incorrect, provide:
- timestamp and system details,
- relevant logs,
- and a concise explanation for review.

## 8. Updates
This Fair Use Policy may be updated; the current version in the repository is authoritative.
