# QuartzOS License Tier Differences

This file defines the current license tiers used by the issuer.

## Tier Map

- community: `0x0001`
- pro: `0x0002`
- enterprise: `0x0004`
- ultimate: `0x0008`
- all: `0x000F` (community + pro + enterprise + ultimate)

## Difference Summary

- `community` includes only bit `0x0001`.
- `pro` includes only bit `0x0002`.
- `enterprise` includes only bit `0x0004`.
- `ultimate` includes only bit `0x0008`.
- `all` includes every tier bit (`0x000F`).

## How It Is Used

- The tier is encoded into the license key `feature_bits` field.
- Example:
  - `QOS1-<id>-<feature_bits>-<sig>`
  - `QOS2-<id>-<feature_bits>-<nonce>-<sig>`
- Verification checks signature + issuance + revocation status.

## Notes

- In current code, tiers are bit flags, not textual roles in the key itself.
- Product-level feature gating should map runtime features to these bits.
